<mark class="text">The first poster has the color relationship of black and white so that the
 composition can focus on and reiterate the 'spectrum' in my selected phrase:
  'gender is a spectrum.' The words are elongated to further expand on the
  spectrum visual and the “E” extends to create an equal sign (which is
  typically attributed to the LGBTQ+ community).
<br>
For the privilege poster,
I chose red and green as those colors usually symbolize the beginning
 and end of something (like in stoplights, stop signs, the changing of
 leaves, etc.) to reflect the meaning of the phrase 'Use the privilege
 (green) to end the privilege (red).' The text seems to enter the gray
  tube in the middle and comes out a different color which was also
  meant to represent change.
  <br>
For my mental health poster, the color relationship is yellow and purple
as yellow is very representative of being happy or joyful, whereas cool
colors tend to be symbolic of feeling anxious or sad. So, the colors
flip and repeat, as I repeat this phrase to myself in my head whenever
I am feeling anxious about something I’m doing. The text also symbolizes
this relationship as the text is written in a way that can be read upside
down as well.</mark>-->
