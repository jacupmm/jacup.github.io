  <br><br>
  <mark class="three"> Creator's Block </mark>
  <br><br>
  <mark class="one"> I created by my own typeface for this project
    using the cut-out shapes seen in the logo and stacking them on a 4x4 grid like
building blocks. The hypothetical event was a Zoom meeting where students in the
Collee of Fine Arts could talk about their creative experiences over quarantine.</mark>

<!--Mental Health Calendar-->
  <div class="portfolio">
    <img class="one" src="https://jacupsandbox.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/calender-project-pages.png">

    <mark class="three"> World Mental Health Day Calendar </mark>
    <br><br>
    <mark class="one"> For this project, the forms in the typography are organic and flowing to represent the
fluidity and fluctuation of mood. Each spread in the calendar talks about various
mental illnesses and how they can be treated.</mark>

    <br><br>
    <mark class="one"> I combined photographs I took on a walk with notes I took while observing
the emotions and scenery around me. The one word hanging over me the
whole walk was “motivation.”</mark>

    <mark class="three"> Pause Poster 2 </mark>
    <br><br>
    <mark class="one"> I pose the question: How does the world around you change when you take a
minute to pause and feel?</mark>
